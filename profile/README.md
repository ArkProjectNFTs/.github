## The Vision

By empowering creators, we aspire to onboard the next millions of digital asset owners.

---

## The Problem

The way digital assets are currently traded is inefficient. The market is fragmented across different blockchains and layers that define a constraining and complex environment for any creators looking to sell digital assets.

The genesis of this problem can be divided into two distinct categories. The first category is related to a lack of initial infrastructure and vision within our ecosystem. The second category relates to the blockchain technology itself.

⛔ **As a result, selling NFTs is a time-consuming and complicated process for creators.**

## The Solution

In the aim to address both categories of problems listed above, we envision a solution built on four main pillars:

1. Choosing the Best Underlying Technology
2. Creators First
3. A Unified and Open-Source Infrastructure
4. Tools for Creators to Scale

<aside>
✅ **Based on those four pillars, our solution aims to make trading digital assets easier by creating a platform that combines everything for creators. By doing so, we are looking to empower creators to build outstanding user experiences that use digital assets in unique and innovative ways.**
